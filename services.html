                       <p>This is our most popular and comprehensive inspection.
                            Designed exclusively for the home buyer, we completely examine the home from top to bottom, inside and out. During our 2-3 hour inspection, nothing is left untouched or not analyzed. Structured for both single family homes and duplexes, we will fully prepare you to completely understand the condition of the home…before you buy it.</p>

                            <p>Environmental testing is never included with any home inspection. However, radon is a very hot topic in today’s real estate market. Consider adding a Radon Test to your home inspection…we can do that!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="service-two">
                        <p>For those purchasing a home but don’t need a complete analysis, this is the inspection for you…just the big stuff. Designed for the experienced buyer or where an inspection has already been done (like a truth-in-housing report), this inspection focuses only on the major portions of the home. During our 1-2 hour inspection, we will determine if the home is structurally sound, the exterior is water tight, and the main electrical, plumbing, heating and cooling systems are safe and in good condition. What we will not do is go room to room looking at things like windows, doors, outlets, sinks, and appliances.</p>
                        <p>Single Family Home $264 / Duplexes $314</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="service-three">
                        This inspection is exactly the same as our complete buyer’s inspection, except you may not want the exterior of the building examined. Because the outside is association owned, it’s your choice whether to have the exterior inspected…or not? Regardless, it’s a complete and thorough 2-3 hour inspection, only it might not include the outside. And for that we will reduce the cost of the inspection.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="service-four">
                        <p>These inspections include the complete interior of the unit and not the common use areas of the building. Most condos do not have a separate furnace, air conditioner and water heater in the unit, however some do. With or without these mechanical systems, an inspection takes about 1-2 hours and we can do it either way.</p>
                        <p>Without In-Unit Mechanicals $229 / With In-Unit Mechanicals $314</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="service-five">
                        <p>Just need one or two things checked out?
                            With only 1 or 2 parts of the house to look at, these inspections can be more focused. These inspections take approximately one hour. Usually, you have identified a possible problem, need to know more about it or maybe how it’s fixed. We can do that!</p>
                             <p>1 Thing $214 / 2 Things $264</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="service-six">
                        <p>Don’t like anything we’re offering? Configure your own style of inspection…just the way you want it. We will listen and advise, just tell us what you need. We’re ok with that!</p>

                <h2 class="page-header">10 Biggest Problems Buyers Should Be Looking For</h2>

                <h3>#1 Basement moisture</h3>
                <p>90% of basement dampness is caused by the earth (landscaping) sloped towards the foundation.</p>

                <h3>#2 Leaking roof</h3>
                <p>Most roofs leak because of bad flashing.  Tar installed over the flashing indicates a leaking that has been temporarily repaired.</p>

                <h3>#3 Failed foundation</h3>
                <p>Unstable foundations are usually caused by the earth sloping towards the house.  This will be disclosed as a horizontal crack.</p>

                <h3>#4 Unsafe furnace or boiler</h3>
                <p>Heating equipment that needs to be replaced will be excessively rusted, scorched, or patched on the outside jacket.</p>

                <h3>#5 Hazardous electrical panel</h3>
                <p>Ungrounded electrical panels are a shock and electrocution danger.  Panels need to be grounded to a cold water pipe or a ground rod.</p>

                <h3>#6 Low water pressure</h3>
                <p>The best way to test the water pressure is by leaving the cold water running in the basement laundry tub and individually checking the other faucets throughout the home.  Bad pressure is generally caused by rusted out galvanized steel pipes.</p>

                <h3>#7 Collapsed underground sewer pipe</h3>
                <p>Run the bathtub and laundry tub simultaneously for about 10 minutes and wait to see if the fixtures backup.  This is the best way to test for a plugged sewer.</p>

                <h3>#8 Leaking water heater</h3>
                <p>Turn the thermostat up to high for about 5 minutes and listen for a noise like popcorn popping.  This indicates excessive corrosion and a leak inside the water tank.</p>

                <h3>#9 Bad windows</h3>
                <p>It’s as simple as operating each window.</p>

                <h3>#10 Environmental hazards</h3>
                <p>The white insulation wrapping heating systems is the most common environmental concern.  Normally this insulation has asbestos fibers inside.</p>

                <h2 class="page-header">Pre-listing Inspections</h2>
                <p>Let’s face it, surprises are only good some of the time, and the surprises that show up during a buyer’s inspection of your home are generally not one of them. If you are getting ready to sell your home, be proactive. A pre-listing inspection can help to identify problem areas that should be corrected prior to putting your house on the market.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A pre-listing inspection follows the same comprehensive format as our buyer’s inspection. It is typically 3-4 hours in length and examines the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lot and Grounds</li>
                    <li>Exterior</li>
                    <li>Roofing</li>
                    <li>Structure</li>
                    <li>Plumbing</li>
                    <li>Electrical</li>
                    <li>Heating</li>
                    <li>Air Conditioning</li>
                    <li>Insulation and Ventilation</li>
                    <li>Interior</li>
                    <li>Fireplaces</li>
                    <li>Appliance Check</li>
                    <li>Garage</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After the inspection, we’ll discuss our findings with you on site. You will also receive a digital copy of the report, complete with pictures of problem areas, within 24 hours. Armed with this knowledge, you will be well equipped to head to market.</p>
