            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <p>The national standard for a home inspection is that it is a visual examination of a buildings systems and components. It does not use technical testing equipment nor is it an invasive or destructive analysis.
                 The conclusions are the inspector’s opinion of the condition of each of these systems, but it is not a future projection or warranty of any component. Because a home inspection is an opinion and not a guarantee, it is important that you value the opinion of your inspector.</p>

                <h1>What Does a Home Inspector Do and are They All the Same?</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <p>Not all inspectors are the same. The quality of any inspection is only as good as the inspector’s knowledge, skill, and experience. A normal home inspection will examine 100’s of building parts and an inspector must be skilled at evaluating them all. Only when these skills are mature, is an inspector capable of examining each part of the house with the same proficiency. A good inspector looks at the surface of things and passes judgment. A great inspector looks beyond to the core of each component as if they can ‘see thru the walls’. And only then does the building analysis have real value.
                In addition to their technical abilities, a great inspector listens to your questions and concerns, is accessible during and after the inspection, respects your time, will smile and be happy during the entire encounter.</p>

                <h1>ASHI Standards of Practice</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <p>The State of MN does not license home inspectors. For that reason, it’s necessary for an inspector to have a 3rd party establish the minimum standards of a home inspection. The American Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI), a national trade association, were first to establish guidelines for professional home inspections. These guidelines have continued to be improved and, nationally, remain the basis of what a professional home inspection consists of. We are a certified member of this association, for the past 20 years, and have adopted their standards of practice for all our inspections.</p>

                <h1>Why Have a Home Inspection?</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <p>Buying a home could be the largest single investment you will ever make. To minimize unpleasant surprises and unexpected difficulties, you will want to learn as much as you can about the house before you buy it.  A home inspection will identify major repairs, as well as the need for maintenance to keep it in good shape.  After the inspection, you will know more about the house, which will allow you to make better decisions with confidence.</p>
                <p>No home inspection is perfect, mistakes can be made. However, a great home inspector should never make mistakes on the major problems of the house. A home inspection should clearly protect the client from catastrophes.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <p>Most home inspections are performed after a purchase agreement has been signed. The reason for this is buyers do not want to spend the money and risk not getting the home. A high demand home inspector will generally require a minimum of 48 hours’ notice.</p>

                Inspector Responsibilities
                Many times the quality of the service you purchase is demonstrated in the company’s follow-up and support. Attention to detail and delivering what you promise is a huge responsibility and few home inspectors do it well. Your expectations must be met. This should include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A timely delivered and high quality customized report</li>
                    <li>Reports distributed to all parties you request</li>
                    <li>Prompt response to after inspection questions and concerns</li>
                    <li>Fully prepared and confident to make an informed decision in the purchase of your home</li>
                    <li>Fair and prompt complaint resolution…if required</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A home or building inspection is typically a limited, non-invasive examination of the condition of the structure, typically performed in connection with a prospective sale.  We are certified by International Association of Certified Home Inspectors (InterNACHI) to complete these inspections associated with residential homes and commercial buildings. 
                The inspection will include a complete walk-thru around the exterior of the structure and interior - to - evaluate and report on any deficiencies or limitations that may be present during the time of inspection.  We encourage you, the prospective home owner, to join us to learn and respond to questions / concerns that may arise during the inspection process. The entire process takes 2 to 3 hours and a report detailing our findings will be prepared to you within 24-48 hours.</p>

                <p>Most home inspections are performed after a purchase agreement has been signed. The reason for this is buyers do not want to spend the money and risk not getting the home. A high demand home inspector will generally require a minimum of 48 hours’ notice.</p>
                <p>Some homes still use well water as a source of consumption.  Any home with an active drinking water or potable water well, should request historic testing data affiliated with that well(s), as several natural and man-made contaminants could be present in your the drinking water.  MEI has tested numerous wells and can facilitate any water testing needs requested.</p>
                <p>We want to take your home / building inspection to the next level to include a thorough inspection for potential environmental hazards that may be detrimental to your health. We have been in the construction and remodeling industry for  over 15 years, prior to adding our inspection services.  We are experts at identifying indoor environmental and structural safety hazards; that if left untreated, could have a detrimental effect on the health of you, your family, or employees.  When hiring Certified Home Inspections to complete your home inspection, you can be certain we are also keeping an eye out for environmental hazards like mold, lead, and even materials that may contain asbestos fiber. This "stuff" does still exist today in homes and buildings, especially in homes constructed prior to 1980.  Even newly constructed homes can pose an environmental threat, as the materials used can deteriorate from water and other forces, which could present a potential mold / breathing issue.</p>
